# Sendy API PHP Wrapper

This project is a fork of Jason Bennett's [SendyPHP](https://github.com/JacobBennett/SendyPHP) project with added support for WordPress core functionality, specifically WP_Error and the HTTP API.

The wrapper is very weighs at a less than 200 lines of code because Sendy's API at the time of release is not very robust.

There are, however, other PHP projects that extend Sendy's API.
